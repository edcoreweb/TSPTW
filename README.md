# TSPTW
The Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows (TSPTW)

I have found this code published at http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~rfsilva/tsptw/
(together with large amount of benchmarks and useful info), added Makefile and some minor adoptioption.

To build it type ```make```. To run - get benchmark set(s) from above.

Happy hacking!
